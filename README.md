# Uncommon MATLAB Error: Division by Zero and Uninformative Error Messages

This repository demonstrates an example of an uncommon MATLAB error involving a combination of input validation and potential division by zero.  The error messages generated by the original code are not very user-friendly.

The `bug.m` file contains the erroneous MATLAB code.  The improved version, which provides better error handling and more informative messages, is in `bugSolution.m`.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.m` and `bugSolution.m` in MATLAB.
3. Run `bug.m` with both negative and zero inputs to observe the original error behavior.
4. Run `bugSolution.m` to see the improved error handling and more informative messages.

## Solution
The solution focuses on:
* More robust input validation with specific error messages indicating the reason for failure.
* Handling potential division by zero using conditional checks and alternative calculations to prevent the error.  This improves the program's robustness and avoids unexpected crashes.
